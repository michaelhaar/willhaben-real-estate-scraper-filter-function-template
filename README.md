# Willhaben RealEstateScraper: FilterFunction Template

This project contains template code which can be forked for developing/testing/debugging the `filterFunction` for the Willhaben RealEstateScraper input.

## Getting started

run `npm run test:ui`

It should run some tests and the test results should be displayed in the preview panel (right side of the StackBlitz editor)

The tests will automatically re-run when we save a file.

Maybe start by inspecting (and editing) one of the following

- `src/filter-function.ts` => contains the `filterFunction` source
- `test/filter-function.test.ts` => contains some test cases
- `test/test-data-factory.ts` => helper file for creating test data
